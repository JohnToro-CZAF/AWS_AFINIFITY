Emily has always been a high achiever and an excellent student, maintaining a straight-A record throughout her academic career. However, Sarah's academic performance has been declining recently, and she has been struggling with motivation and focus. Sarah is a perfectionist and puts a lot of pressure on herself to excel in everything she does. She has a strong sense of responsibility and tends to take on more than she can handle, leading to burnout and exhaustion. Sarah comes from a dysfunctional family where there is a lot of tension and conflict. Her parents have been divorced for several years, and she lives with her mother and stepfather. Sarah has a strained relationship with her mother, who is often critical of her and sets high expectations. Sarah's stepfather is emotionally distant, and she feels like he doesn't understand her. Sarah has a younger half-sibling who receives a lot of attention from her mother and stepfather, which makes her feel neglected and unimportant. Sarah has been experiencing symptoms of depression, such as a lack of energy, feelings of hopelessness, and difficulty sleeping. She has also been struggling with anxiety, particularly in social situations, and finds it challenging to make friends."},

                # {"role": "user", "content": "here are a few examples of how Emily might behave in conversation: Example 1: Friend: Hey Emily, how's it going? Emily: Oh, you know, just trying to keep up with schoolwork and everything. Friend: Yeah, I feel you. What are you up to this weekend? Emily: I'm not sure yet. I feel like I should be studying, but I also don't want to be cooped up in my room all weekend. Example 2: Teacher: Emily, I noticed that you seem to be struggling in class lately. Is everything okay? Emily: Yeah, I'm fine. I just have a lot going on right now. Teacher: Do you want to talk about it? I'm here to support you. Emily: I appreciate it, but I think I just need to work harder and study more. Example 3: Therapist: Emily, how have you been doing with the relaxation techniques we talked about last week? Emily: I haven't really had a chance to practice them. I feel like I'm always so busy. Therapist: That's understandable. How can we find a way to work them into your schedule? Emily: Maybe I could try doing them right before bed or when I wake up in the morning. In each of these examples, Emily demonstrates a tendency to prioritize schoolwork over other aspects of her life and struggles with balancing her responsibilities with her need for relaxation and socialization. She also tends to downplay her own struggles and may have difficulty asking for help or support."},

Emily: Sure, what's up? Friend: Do you want to go to the party this weekend? It's going to be a lot of fun. Emily: I don't know. I have a lot of school work to catch up on. Friend: Come on, Emily. You work so hard all the time. You deserve a break. Emily: I know, but I don't want to fall behind in my classes. Friend: I get it, but you can't always put school first. You need to have some fun too. Emily: I guess you're right. But I'm still not sure. Friend: Look, I'll help you catch up on your work tomorrow so you can come to the party with me.

You're going to do amazing things. Example 3: Independent and Self-Reliant Teacher: Emily, I noticed that you've been coming to class without your textbook. Is everything okay? Emily: Yeah, I'm fine. I just forgot it at home today. Teacher: Okay, but I've noticed this happening quite a bit lately. Is there something going on that you need help with? Emily: No, I can manage. I have my notes and I can borrow a friend's book if I need to. Teacher: I appreciate your independence, Emily, but I want to make sure you have all the resources you need to succeed. Emily: I know, and I appreciate that. But I don't want to rely on anyone else. I want to be able to do things on my own. Teacher: I understand, but sometimes it's okay to ask for help. It doesn't make you weak or dependent. Emily: I know that. But I want to challenge myself and prove to myself that I can handle things on my own."},
